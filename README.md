**Problem Statement**

Security teams face alert overload from disconnected tools, making it hard to identify, prioritize, and respond to real threats. 
Without centralized, actionable insights, critical risks are missed and response times suffer.

**Dashboard Walkthrough**

To deliver clear, actionable insights tailored to the unique priorities of key stakeholders, 
I structured the dashboard into four strategic views: 

1. Executive View for high-level visibility tailored to the CISO and leadership.
2. Category View for risk segmentation across domains.
3. City View to localize threats geographically.
4. Incident Type View to support the SOC team in threat pattern analysis and operational response.

**Recommendations**

Deploy advanced security systems for early threat detection and response; conduct regular cyber response drills.

Support small businesses with basic security tools like antivirus and backups; set up local help centers for reporting cyber issues.

Implement real-time monitoring and automated threat response; maintain regular data backups and disaster recovery plans.

Offer ongoing security awareness training; monitor for patterns that may escalate into major threats.

**What I learnt**

Acquired domain knowledge in cybersecurity, including key concepts, threats, and mitigation strategies.

Improved ability to generate relevant and targeted insights aligned with specific problem statements.

Enhanced storytelling skills to present findings more clearly, effectively, and impactfully.
