**Introduction**

Indiaâ€™s rapid digital transformation has led millions of users to rely on digital platforms for banking, communication, and commerce.
While this growth fuels innovation, it also exposes the country to increasing cyber threats. 
Recognizing this, I chose to analyze real-world cybersecurity incident data to uncover meaningful patterns and insights 
that can guide effective cyber risk management.

**Problem Statement**

As cyber threats continue to rise in frequency and sophistication, 
it has become increasingly difficult for organizations' CISO and cybersecurity team 
to prioritize risks and respond to threats promptly. 

They need a centralized, data-driven solution to clearly understand 
where, how, and why cybersecurity incidents are occurring.

**Goal of the dashboard**

This dashboard is built to support cyber team in analyzing the types of incidents,
frequency and financial impact of cybercrimes across cities, categories and time periods.

The goal of the dashboard is to expose high risk zones and emerging threat patterns 
to act quickly, respond smartly and make strategic data driven decisions
to strengthen cyber security defenses and minimize future risk.

**Dashboard Walkthrough**

To deliver clear, actionable insights tailored to the unique priorities of key stakeholders, 
I structured the dashboard into four strategic views: 

1. Executive View for high-level visibility tailored to the CISO and leadership.
2. Category View for risk segmentation across domains.
3. City View to localize threats geographically.
4. Incident Type View to support the SOC team in threat pattern analysis and operational response.
