Hello all, and welcome. I'm Anusha, and today I’ll walk you through a dashboard I created recently for analyzing cybersecurity incidents in India.


**Introduction**

India’s rapid digital transformation has led millions of users to rely on digital platforms for banking, communication, and commerce.
This growth exposes the country to increasing cyber threats. 
That’s what drove me to create this dashboard—an in-depth analysis of cybersecurity incidents in India to uncover meaningful patterns and insights 
that can guide in cyber risk management.

Let’s dive into the data—and what it means for our digital defenses."

**Problem Statement**

As cyber threats continue to rise in frequency and sophistication, 
it has become increasingly difficult for organizations' CISO and cybersecurity team 
to prioritize risks and respond to threats promptly. 

They need a centralized, data-driven solution to clearly understand 
where, how, and why cybersecurity incidents are occurring.

**Goal of the dashboard**

This dashboard is built to support cyber team in analyzing the types of incidents,
frequency and financial impact of cybercrimes across cities, categories and time periods.

The goal of the dashboard is to expose high risk zones and emerging threat patterns 
to act quickly, respond smartly and make strategic data driven decisions
to strengthen cyber security defenses and minimize future risk.

**Dashboard Walkthrough**

To deliver clear, actionable insights tailored to the unique priorities of key stakeholders, 
I structured the dashboard into four strategic views: 

1. Executive View for high-level visibility tailored to the CISO and leadership.
2. Category View for risk segmentation across domains.
3. City View to localize threats geographically.
4. Incident Type View to support the SOC team in threat pattern analysis and operational response.
